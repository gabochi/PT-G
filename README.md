Text generator, bash IA.

## Separating all words

`grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt`

With grep you can filter texts with REGEX. In this case, we use extended REGEX (-E) and print only matches (-o).
`"[^ ]+ "` Selects a group any characters (excluding space) followed by a space.
The result all words (including their punctuation). 

## Counting occurrences

`grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt | sort | uniq -c`

`grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt | head -n 1`

`grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt | shuf`

`grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt | shuf | head -n 3`

`grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt | shuf | head -n 3 | tr -d "\n"`

`grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt | shuf | tr -d "\n"`

`grep "\." dataset.txt`

`while true; do WORD=$(grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt | shuf | head -n 1); echo -n "$WORD"; [ "$(echo "$WORD" | grep "\." )" != "" ] && break; done`

```bash
while true 
do 
    WORD=$(grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt | shuf | head -n 1)
    echo -n "$WORD"
    [ "$(echo "$WORD" | grep "\." )" != "" ] && break
done
```

`grep -Eo "[A-Z][^ ]+ " dataset.txt`

```bash
echo -n "$(grep -Eo "[A-Z][^ ]+ " dataset.txt | shuf | head -n 1)"
while true 
do 
    WORD=$(grep -Eo "[^ ]+ " dataset.txt | shuf | head -n 1)
    echo -n "$WORD"
    [ "$(echo "$WORD" | grep "\." )" != "" ] && break
done
```

`grep -Eo "you [^ ]+ " dataset.txt | sed "s/you //g"`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
